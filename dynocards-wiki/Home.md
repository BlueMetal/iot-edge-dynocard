Welcome to the Oil-Gas IoT Solution.

### About Oil & Gas Solution

Oil and Gas companies want to operate the sucker pumps in an efficient, safe and environmentally responsible manner. Companies use dynamometers (dyno) surveys to determine the condition of the pump operating beneath the ground or downhole. Medium to large oil companies can have thousands of these pumps scattered throughout remote areas of the world. It is very costly to inspect thousands of Dyno Cards individually.
A technology solution can be implemented to detect issues with the pump using data points captured from the Dyno Card, capture historical data, potentially stop the pump and alert field technicians.
